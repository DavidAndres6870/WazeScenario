# Waze Scenario
## Course 3 workplace scenario

**Project goal:**

Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

**Background:**

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. 

**Scenario:**

Your team is still in the early stages of their user churn project. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal, and used Python to inspect and organize Waze’s user data. Now, the data is ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and further data visualization. 

**Course 3 tasks:**
- Clean data
- Handle outliers 
- Perform EDA
- Visualize data
- Share an executive summary with the Waze data team
